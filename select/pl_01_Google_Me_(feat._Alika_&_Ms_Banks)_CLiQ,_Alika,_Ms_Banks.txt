Keep it real, I been true to me
Been out in the fields,
this ain't new to me
No, a new to you,
don't be confused
I got accolades
and Google got proof
I create the wave,
they do what I do
Can't do it like me though,
I'm the idol
I got swagger, grace,
sauce with manners
Let 'em hate,
the hate be standard
I'll be great,
the wastes don't matter
Google me babes,
see how my ting patterned
I'm a big deal, Google me
No time to chill, Google me
Everything real, Google me
Google me, Google me, Google me

Google me, Google me, Google me
Google me, Google me,
Google me, Google me
Ayy, ayy
Google me, Google me, Google me
I've been ballin',
man, this isn't new to me
When I step
in the dance they're like
'Who is she?'
'Bout my money,
I speak that ish fluently
Used to be on the roads,
doing truancy
They be hating
but they can't get through to me
Pillow talking,
you know you ain't fooling me
Want a piece? Tell me,
what can you do for me?
Uh, in the club,
we be cutting a rug
Hopping about,
none of my girls giving it up
All of the boys loving us
and they can't get enough
Like, check my wrist out
I'm a big deal, Google me
No time to chill, Google me
Everything real, Google me
Google me, Google me, Google me
I'm a big deal, Google me
No time to chill, Google me
Everything real, Google me
Google me, Google me, Google me
Google me, Google me,
Google me, Google me
Google me, Google me, Google me
Yo, Google me
I see a lotta tomfoolery
On top, how gon'
get through to me?
Ride solo, no crew with me
Levels to this,
I'm in a new league
Big boss, real boss,
cannot bully me (Huh)
Put respect on my name, yeah?
Who you know flow cold,
lowkey like me?
Done dirt, put
in work for the crown
Know my name been
the word round town
I'm the wave, I got sauce,
don't drown
Old flame wanna come back round
(Old flame wanna
come back round)
(Old flame wanna
come back round)
A-L-I-K-A, Google me
I'm a big deal, Google me
No time to chill, Google me
Everything real, Google me
Google me, Google me, Google me
I'm a big deal, Google me
No time to chill, Google me
Everything real, Google me
Google me, Google me, Google me
