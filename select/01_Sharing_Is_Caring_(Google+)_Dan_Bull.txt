I'm having trouble with Google+
'Cause I don't know who to trust
Do we need another place for stupid stuff?
Remember MySpace?
It was a nice place
Now Myspace Tom uses Google
So it's clear which one's more useful
One plus one is two
But if you only get one +1, it's poo
Lots of filters for content anew
But there's not one that tells us
What bit is true!
It's doubtful to me
I can helpfully glean that
From the crap moving up and down on my screen
I've run out of steam with the amount in my stream
But in cyberspace
Who can tell when you scream?
Six hundred million people like me like this
Are you taking the piss?
Or is there something I've missed?
Six hundred million people like me like this
Are you taking the piss?
My social ties are total lies
But I'm too tied in to show you why
I'm totally fly when I socialise
I've got a bigger circle than the Goatse guy
Though I'm uncertain how circles work
Is it some kind of circle jerk?
Cause it seems to me that the hangout
Is just a place for good mates
To get their wang out
Hang about, I don't wanna stand out
I'm just trying to protect my ring
Like Gandalf
And nowadays, staying private's an art
Michaelangelo's David's private parts
Couldn't be more on view than you
So I might as well use my googlies
As a Google Doodle
When Google don't know what I'm googling
They know my shoe size, my bowel movements
And the mood I'm in
The bits I miss when I do the hoovering
And with whom I'm canoodling
Never mind recycling
Move me to the loony bin
If Google's the future
Then losers are Ubermensch
Six hundred million people like me like this
Are you taking the piss?
Or is there something I've missed?
Six hundred million people like me like this
Are you taking the piss?
Or is there something I've missed?
Six hundred million people like me like this
Are you taking the piss?
