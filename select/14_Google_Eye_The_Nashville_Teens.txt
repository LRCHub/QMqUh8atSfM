Jump in me old jeep wagon
Bump it to the banks of the river
Dig me a worm and a cricket squirm
And a-wade out into the water
Oh, goodbye google eye
Eat him up a-google eye a-google eye a-google eye
Eat him up a-google eye a-google eye a-google eye
Goodbye google eye Bait me a hook in the morning
Throw him out into the water
Make him swim with a dorsal fin
And come home to me daughter
Oh oh goodbye google eye... Google eye swim by me hipboot
Look up at me from the water
Google eye chomp and me fall on me romp
But me get him up out of the water
Oh goodbye google eye... Google eye fry in the sizzle
Sweet smoke lay on the water
Take old google eye's scales 'n tails
Home to me daughter
Oh goodbye google eye
Ate him up a-google eye, a-google eye, a-google eye
Ate him up a-google eye, a-google eye, a-google eye
Good bye google eye
